    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <h3 class="italic">Why should I have my own website?</h3>
    <p>
      There are several reasons you may want a personal website; whether you want 
      a blog, portfolio, cv, or just a place to tell the world about yourself 
      outside of traditional social media, a personal website is a great thing to 
      have. Having a personal website does not require that you host that site 
      yourself, and in fact most people don't host their own sites - many services 
      such as WordPress, Squarespace, and Wix.com offer people a fast, easy, and 
      affordable way to build and host a website, and for most people, a service 
      like this is probably the best option.
    </p>
    <h3 class="italic">Why would I want to host the site myself?</h3>
    <p>
      Realistically, most people probably don't. This guide is specifically 
      targeted at people who wish to better understand how the web works by 
      building a small piece of it themselves, and while this route can offer 
      a site that is lighter, faster, and gives you more granular control than 
      those built with the management systems mentioned above, the extra effort 
      probably isn't worth it unless you have a strong desire to learn and tinker. 
      For those who are willing to put in the effort, however, hosting your own 
      website can be incredibly rewarding and allows you to build something truly 
      unique without the limitations of hosting platforms.
    </p>
    <h3 class="italic">What is a static website and why might I want one?</h3>
    <p>
      Simply put, a static website is a website with fixed content built using 
      HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript. The alternative to a static website is a 
      dynamic website, which is what you're probably used to seeing with sites like 
      Twitter, Google, and Netflix. These sites are built with web frameworks like 
      React or Angular and dynamically serve content to users, which is why the 
      content you see is different every time you visit one of these sites. It is 
      important to note that static websites can still be responsive, 
      cross-platform, and can even have dynamic elements (though that's outside the 
      scope of this guide). The reason this guide focuses on static sites, aside 
      from their relative simplicity, is because they provide a strong, stable 
      foundation on which to build, tinker, and ultimately deepen your understanding 
      of the web.
    </p>
    <h3 class="italic">What should I already know?</h3>
    <p>
      This guide assumes that you have no experience with the tools and platforms 
      used. With that in mind, you should be very comfortable using a computer, and 
      you mustn't fear the command line - it is a powerful tool that makes 
      everything in this guide possible. Because this guide focuses on hosting 
      rather than designing a website, there won't be an explanation of how to 
      build your website with HTML and CSS; that said, there will be links to 
      external resources for that at the end of the guide.
    </p>
    <h3 class="italic">How long will this take?</h3>
    <p>
      Due to the nature of wireless networking, wait times between certain steps 
      can be unpredictable. You should expect to spend about two to three hours 
      getting your site set up (less if you're already familiar with the tools), 
      and many more hours tinkering and troubleshooting as you expand your site 
      into whatever you want it to be.
    </p>
    <h3>Important Technologies & Terminology</h3>
    <ul>

    <h3 id="warning">Warning!</h3>
    <p>
      This guide makes heavy use of bash, and specifically the sudo command, which 
      allows the user to run commands with elevated privileges. When following any 
      guide involving bash it is essential that you carefully check any command 
      involving sudo before executing, as this command allows you to do significant 
      damage to your system if used improperly.
    </p>
    <h3 id="caution">Caution</h3>
    <p>
      While this guide will follow basic security practices, there are many 
      security risks that come with hosting a website. You should never upload 
      anything to the web server that you wouldn't want publicly visible, and you 
      shouldn't attempt to handle user data without significant further research.
    </p>
    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      These instructions will involve the following actions: 
      <ol>
        <li>Set up ssh on your device.</li>
        <li>Sign up for DigitalOcean and create a droplet.</li>
        <li>Install web hosting software on your server.</li>
        <li>Set up a domain name for your website.</li>
        <li>Configure Nginx for domain name.</li>
        <li>Set up TLS.</li>
        <li>Upload custom website files to server.</li>
      </ol>
    <h3 id="what-youll-need">What You'll Need</h3>
    <p>
      The only things you'll need to get started are a computer connected to the 
      internet and about $15. This guide will primarily target Windows users, but 
      everything here is possible on nearly any modern operating system. Over the 
      course of this guide, you'll have to pay about $5 per month for a server, and 
      about $10 per year for a domain name.

        <p>
          Open the command line for your operating system. To do this on Windows, 
          right click the start menu and click the <em>Windows PowerShell</em> 
          option (<em>Figure 2</em> below).
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          <strong>Note</strong>: You should <strong>not</strong> 
          choose the option that says <em>Admin</em>, since admin privileges are 
          unnecessary here.
        </p>
        <p class="feedback">
          You should see the window in <em>Figure 3</em> once the command line opens.

          <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa</code>
          <li>Press enter to run the command.</li>
          <li>Press enter at each prompt, leaving the passphrase empty.</li>
          <p class="note">
            <strong>Note</strong>: You may set a passhprase if you'd like, but 
            setting a passphrase is unnecessary and not common practice.
