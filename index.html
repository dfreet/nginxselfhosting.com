<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h3 id="why-should-i-have-my-own-website">Why should I have my own
website?</h3>
<p>There are several reasons you may want a personal website; whether
you want a blog, [[portfolio]], cv, or just a place to tell the world
about yourself outside of traditional social media, a personal website
is a great thing to have. Having a personal website does not require
that you host that site yourself, and in fact most people don’t host
hteir own sites - many services such as WordPress, Squarespace, and
Wix.com offer people a fast, easy, and affordable way to build and host
a website, and for most people, a service like this is probably the best
option.</p>
<h3 id="why-would-i-want-to-host-the-site-myself">Why would I want to
host the site myself?</h3>
<p>Realistically, most people probably don’t. This guide is specifically
targeted at people who wish to better understand how the web works by
building a small piece of it themselves, and while this route can offer
a site that is lighter, faster, and gives you more granular control than
those built with the management systems mentioned above, the extra
effort probably isn’t worth it unless you have a strong desire to learn
and tinker. For those who are willing to put in the effort, however,
hosting your own website can be incredibly rewarding and allows you to
build something truly unique without the limitations of hosting
platforms.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-static-website-and-why-might-i-want-one">What is a
static website and why might I want one?</h3>
<p>Simply put, a static website is a website with fixed content built
using [[HTML]], [[CSS]], and possibly [[JavaScript]]. The alternative to
a static website is a dynamic website, which is what you’re probably
used to seeing with sites like Twitter, Google, and Netflix. These sites
are built with web frameworks like React or Angular and dynamically
serve content to users, which is why the content you see is different
every time you visit one of these sites. It is important to note that
static websites can still be responsive, cross-platform, and can even
have dynamic elements (though that’s outside the scope of this guide).
The reason this guide focuses on static sites, aside from their relative
simplicity, is because they provide a strong, stable foundation on which
to build, tinker, and ultimately deepen your understanding of the
web.</p>
<h3 id="what-should-i-already-know">What should I already know?</h3>
<p>This guide assumes that you have no experience with the tools and
platforms used. With that in mind, you should be very comfortable using
a computer, and you mustn’t fear the [[command line]] - it is a powerful
tool that makes everything in this guide possible. Because this guide
focuses on [[hosting]] rather than designing a website, there won’t be
an explanation of how to build your website with HTML and CSS; that
said, there will be links to external resources for that at the end of
the guide.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-will-this-take">How long will this take?</h3>
<p>Due to the nature of wireless networking, wait times between certain
steps can be unpredictable. You should expect to spend about two to
three hours getting your site set up (less if you’re already familiar
with the tools), and many more hours tinkering and troubleshooting as
you expand your site into whatever you want it to be.</p>
<p>[[Sentence Definitions]] ### Important Technologies &amp; Terminology
- <strong>[[HTTP]]</strong> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - HTTP is an

website’s main domain name. (E.g., <strong>www</strong>.example.com,
<strong>en</strong>.wikipedia.org) - <strong>DNS</strong> (Domain Name
System) - DNS is the naming system that manages domain names and links
them to web servers. - <strong>Symbolic Link</strong> - A symbolic link
is a file that points to a different file or directory, similar to

<h3 id="warning">Warning!</h3>
<p>This guide makes heavy use of bash, and specifically the sudo
command, which allows the user to run commands with elevated privileges.
When following any guide involving bash it is essential that you
carefully check any command involving sudo before executing, as this
command allows you to do significant damage to your system if used
improperly.</p>
<h3 id="caution">Caution</h3>
<p>While this guide will follow basic security practices, there are many
security risks that come with hosting a website. You should never upload
anything to the web server that you wouldn’t want publicly visible, and
you shouldn’t attempt to handle user data without significant further
research.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>These instructions will involve the following actions: 1. Set up ssh
on your device 2. Sign up for DigitalOcean and create a droplet 3.
Install web hosting software on server 4. Set up a domain name for your
site 5. Configure website on server 6. Set up TLS 7. Upload Custom
Website files</p>
<h3 id="what-youll-need">What You’ll Need</h3>
<p>The only things you’ll need to get started are a computer connected
to the internet and about $15. This guide will primarily target Windows
users, but everything here is possible on nearly any modern operating
system. Over the course of this guide, you’ll have to pay about $5 per
month for a server, and about $10 per year for a domain name.</p>
<h1 id="steps">Steps</h1>
<p>[[Instruction Steps]] ## SSH Setup 1. Open command line. - Open the
command line for your operating system. To do this on Windows, right
click the start menu and click the “Windows PowerShell” option
(<em>Figure 2</em>). - <strong>Note</strong>: You should
<strong>not</strong> choose the option that says “Admin”, since admin
privileges are unnecessary here - You should see the window in
<em>Figure 3</em> once the command line opens - [<em>Figure 2: Windows
start options menu</em>] -&gt; [<em>Figure 3: Windows PowerShell</em>]
2. Generate SSH keys for authentication. 1. Type or copy/paste the
following command in your command prompt. <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa</code>
2. Press enter to run the command. 3. Press enter at each prompt,
leaving the passphrase empty - <strong>Note</strong>: You can set a
passphrase if you’d like, but this is unnecessary and not common
practice. - You should see text that looks like the following when
you’re done:
<code>Generating public/private rsa key pair.           Enter file in which to save the key (C:\Users\username/.ssh/id_rsa):           Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):           Enter same passphrase again:           Your identification has been saved in C:\Users\username/.ssh/id_rsa.           Your public key has been saved in C:\Users\username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
